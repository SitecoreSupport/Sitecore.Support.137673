# Sitecore.Support.137673
The `Empty strings are not allowed` error may occur while submitting `ASP.NET MVC Forms`.<br/>
It happens when the `Localized Parameters` field on an item that represents a required field on a form doesn't contain the following value:<br/>
`<DynamicRequiredAttribute>The {0} field is required.</DynamicRequiredAttribute>`<br/>
This patch prevents from the described error.
